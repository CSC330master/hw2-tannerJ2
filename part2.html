Q6:How can we build a server that is capable of serving all types of files
without having to change the code every time?
There are built in modules that we can use so it doesnt have to change
much of the code i think

Q7: The http server should probably able to send html, js, and other files 
to the browser, as well as respond to queries/routes like the one you 
implemented in homework assignment 2. How can we combine all 
these features in the same server?
I believe this would have to do with the path file name? similar to how 
jpgs and html is sent
